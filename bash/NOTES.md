# General information.
  *  An interactive shell has its standard input and standard error (and here - its standard output) connected to a terminal.
  *  A non-interactive shell does not have any connectinos to stdin, stdout and stderr.
  *  /etc/profile and ~/.profile is called ONLY when you log in to an interactive shell - i.e. tty or pts.
  *  /etc/bashrc and ~/.bashrc is called EVERY time the bash interpreter is envoked.
  *  ~/.profile is NOT called if ~/.bash_profile OR ~/.bash_login exsits.
  *  When bash is started via gnome-terminal, xterm or konsole /etc/profile, ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bash_login is NOT read.
  *  Put stuff you want to run ONCE in ~/.bash_profile OR ~/.profile.
  *  Put personal system-wide environment variables and run startup scripts in /etc/profile for all shells.
  *  Put personal user environment variables and run startup scripts in ~/.profile for all shells.
  *  Put personal bash-only environment variables and run startup scripts in ~/.bash_profile.
  *  Put personal bash-only aliases and functions in ~/.bashrc.
  *  Prefer ~/.profile because zsh, ash and the like will also read it.
  *  Put stuff you want to run EVERY TIME your shell does something (like spawn a subshell) into ~/.bashrc.
  *  If it is 'exported' it goes into ~/.profile.
  *  *PATH*s goes into ~/.profile.
  *  PS* goes into ~/.profile.
  *  Source ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc from ~/.bash_profile.
  *  Don''t bother with a ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login.
  *  '!!NB!!' If .profile exists, .bashrc is not sourced automatically - source it from .profile.


# What does bash do when it starts?
    From bash man pages...

    When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option;
      it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists,
      after reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable,
        the --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

    When a login shell exits, bash reads and executes commands from the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.

    When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started;
      bash reads and executes commands from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if these files exist.
        This may be inhibited by using the --norc option.
        The --rcfile file option will force bash to read and execute commands from file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.

    When started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, bash looks for BASH_ENV, expands it, uses value as the name of a file to read and execute. Bash behaves as follows:
       if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi
    but the value of the PATH variable is not used to search for the filename.
